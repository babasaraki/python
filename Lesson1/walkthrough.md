Exploring the features of Binder, running a simple script, and typing python commands in a terminal environment

## Walkthrough

Go to introductory python script by clicking the launch pad, navigating to the subdirectory Lesson1, and double clicking `L1.py`.

A new tab should appear with the lesson 1 python script.

Take some time to explore and mouse over the icons and menus.
By going to `Settings > Text Editor Theme`, for example, you can customize your notebook display.

In order to be able to run python code, we want to launch a console. To do so, go to ` File > New Console For Editor`
A pop up window should prompt you to choose a channel from a drop down menu. Select Python3. the console should appear below the notebook code.

There are several ways to run our code from the Run menu.
We can select individual sections of code within the notebook followed by `Run > Run Selected Code`

To run the entire code, we can simply do `Run > Run All Code`


Alternatively, we can type

```
run L1.py
```

in to our console, select that text with our cursor, and go to `Run > Run Selected Code`

Try to run the script several times using these different methods. This script should prompt the user to type in their name 
(what is called **standard input**) and return a custom greeting. 

The text output of this program to the console is called **standard output**

Notice that your console will start to get crowded.
To clear a selection of text from your console, select with your cursor. Then go to 'Edit > Clear Console Cells'

To exit the notebook, simply x out the browser window. Although it is not applicable for this lesson, note there are several
options for saving your work in the 'File' menu
