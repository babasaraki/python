# Hands-on Tutorial

In this tutorial, the participant will learn how to set and determine the datatype of a variable using python methods,
and apply some of the built-in python string functions to manipulate the way that text is displayed in print statements. 

The participant may refer to the following tables as needed:

**TABLE I**: DataTypes and corresponding python methods


| DataType      |python method        |
| ------------- |:------------------: |
| text          | str                 |
| numeric       | int, float, complex |
| Boolean       | bool                |
| binary        | bytes, memoryview   |
| set           | set                 |
| mapping       | dict                |
| seqence       | list, tuple, range  |

**TABLE II**: Python escape characters

| escape char.  | encoding            |
| ------------- |:------------------: |
| \\'           | single quote        |
| \\\           | backslash           |
| \n            | new line            |
| \r            | carriage return     |
| \t            | tab                 |
| \b            | backspace           |

The pre-written code contains only two lines

In the first line, a *variable* `y` is set as the integer, 6. Python will automatically classify the variable's datatype based on the user's input if the datatype is not explicitly set. 

The second line uses the python function `print` to show the variable in standard output and the datatype

Run the code to see standard output. For instructions on launching console and running code selections, see [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/biovcnet/python/tree/master/Lesson1)

Notice that the print statement prints the integer 6, which 'y' is now set to, and the datatype- class int


In the text editor:

retype the the variable declaration and the print function below to set the variable using each python method in the *python function* column of **Table I**. The print statement remain the same, but must be repeated each time the variable is reset,
because y is no longer the same.
