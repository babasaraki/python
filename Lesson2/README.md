# Hands-on Tutorial

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/biovcnet/pythonBinderContent-L2/master?urlpath=lab)

In this tutorial, the participant will learn how to set and determine the datatype of a variable using python methods,
and apply some of the built-in python string functions to manipulate the way that text is displayed in print statements. 

The participant may refer to the following tables as needed:

**TABLE I**: DataTypes and corresponding python methods


| DataType      |python method        |
| ------------- |:------------------: |
| text          | str                 |
| numeric       | int, float, complex |
| Boolean       | bool                |
| binary        | bytes, memoryview   |
| set           | set                 |
| mapping       | dict                |
| seqence       | list, tuple, range  |

**TABLE II**: Python escape characters

| escape char.  | encoding            |
| ------------- |:------------------: |
| \\'           | single quote        |
| \\\           | backslash           |
| \n            | new line            |
| \r            | carriage return     |
| \t            | tab                 |
| \b            | backspace           |

The pre-written code contains only two lines

In the first line, a *variable* `y` is set as the integer, 6. Python will automatically classify the variable's datatype based on the user's input. 

The second line uses the python function `print` to show the variable in standard output and the datatype

Run the code to see standard output. For instructions on launching console and running code selections, see [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/biovcnet/python/tree/master/Lesson1)

In the text editor:

repeat the function to set the variable as each datatype in **Table I**. The print statement remain the same.
